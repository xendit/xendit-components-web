# Examples

We provide complete working examples for:

- **[React Integration](../demos/react/README.md)** - Complete e-commerce demo with React hooks and components
- **[jQuery Integration](../demos/jquery/README.md)** - Traditional jQuery-based payment implementation

**Running the Demos:**

To set up and start the demo applications, run the demos script from the project root:

```bash
./demos.ts
```

This will build all demo applications and start a local development server where you can interact with working examples of the Xendit Components SDK.
